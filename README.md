# Mobile Device Price Range Prediction using LightGBM
## Overview
This project implements a classification system using LightGBM to predict the price range of mobile devices based on their specifications. Accurately pricing devices is crucial for sellers to remain competitive and optimize their sales strategy.

## Problem Statement
For sellers, pricing mobile devices accurately based on their characteristics is essential to avoid reduced sales or diminished profit margins. This project aims to develop an AI model that classifies mobile device price ranges reliably.
## Model and Performance
The model utilizes LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework, achieving an accuracy of 96%. 
LightGBM was chosen for its efficiency in handling large datasets and its capability to optimize training speed and model performance.
